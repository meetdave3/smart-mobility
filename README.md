# Smart Mobility Hackathon 2020

- Meet Dave
- Petru Conduraru

## Why? 

Reduce accident incidents






## How? 

By finding patterns & drawing map clusters based on the factors that may have influenced the accident. 






## Input Data? 

- Road: E39
- Duration: 2011 - now
- Number of accidents? - 274
- Data downloaded from https://vegkart.atlas.vegvesen.no/#kartlag:geodata/@-50359,6747758,11/hva:~(~(id~570))/valgt:230286018:570






## Analysis: Same type of accidents occurring at the same place

Example 2 accidents occurred at the same place due to poor visibility.

A mitigation plan can be created to stop that incident from occurring again.

After the plan is implemented, the system can monitor for similar type of accidents in the future. 

Similar accident patterns can be found across all roads. Automated mitigation plans can be raised. 






## Factor considered in this proof of concept? 

Dark visibility without lights







## Other possible factors that can be switched to? 






### From the API data
- Number of serious injuries
- Kilometres driven by the car
- Weather temperature
- Road width






### Other factors that can be considered (not received from API at present)
- Direction of sun shine (if skies are clear?)
- Wind speed (if weather was stormy?)
- Weather data at time of accident (if it can be possibly retrieved from car sensors?)
- Car speed at the time of accident (if it can be possibly retrieved from car sensors?)
